Return only valid JSON. Do not return markdown.

Use the text prompt only to identify the relevant subject, object, target, result, action/state, or expected region. Answer from the video evidence.

Your job is to answer three judgeability questions about the video.

Question 1:
Does the prompt-critical visual evidence become out of view, occluded, hidden by camera motion, heavily cropped, too blurred, too small, or otherwise unclear such that the prompt-critical evidence cannot be judged for concrete position or action/state during that interval?

Question 2:
After that interval, is later video evidence clear enough to judge the prompt-critical subject, object, result, expected region, support, container, or stable anchor for concrete position, absence, action, state, result, reset, vanish, or failure?

Question 3:
If later evidence returns, is it still too unclear or unidentifiable to make any concrete position/action/state judgment?

Rules:
- Do not decide whether the video is correct.
- Wrong but clearly visible returned evidence is still judgeable.
- A failed action, wrong position, reset, vanished result, or absent object is still judgeable if the later view is clear enough to judge it.
- Do not require proof that it is the exact same physical instance; use later clear evidence of the relevant subject, object, or region when it is enough to judge the prompt-critical state.
- Set oov_applicable true only when there is a relevant visibility gap and later evidence returns clear enough to judge.
- Set oov_applicable false when there is no initial clear evidence, no relevant visibility gap, no later return, or the later evidence is still too unclear to judge.

Use only the video and the text request. Use the text request only to identify what visual evidence to inspect. The text request itself is not evidence that the event, result, gap, return, absence, or failure occurred. Do not use metadata, filenames, model names, dataset names, or outside knowledge.

Text request:
{world_state_prompt}

Answer true only when all of these are satisfied:
- before the visibility gap, some prompt-relevant reference is visible enough to orient the request. This can be the relevant entity, target region, support surface, expected result region, action context, or stable visual context;
- then the relevant evidence becomes not clearly judgeable for a meaningful interval. It does not need to fully disappear. Camera motion, cropping, partial out-of-frame view, occlusion, blur, being too small, cut/discontinuity, or unstable visual evidence can count;
- later, the video shows clear enough relevant evidence to judge the requested visual outcome.

Later clear evidence can include:
- the relevant entity or region again;
- the expected result clearly absent or vanished;
- a reset, failed action, wrong state, wrong position, or non-completion;
- a clear identity switch or replacement, only if it is tied to the requested role, region, action, object, or result.

Do not judge whether the requested outcome is correct. A wrong outcome, failed action, missing object, absence, reset, or prompt-tied identity switch is still judgeable if it is visible clearly enough.

Answer false only when the video lacks enough relevant visible evidence: no prompt-relevant reference before the gap, no meaningful visibility gap, no later relevant evidence, later evidence too unclear, later evidence irrelevant, or the request is not visually judgeable from the video.

Use "no_meaningful_visibility_gap" only when the relevant evidence remains continuously visible and judgeable, or when there is no real prompt-relevant hidden/unjudgeable interval. Do not answer true for ordinary continuously visible evidence with no such gap.

Use "later_irrelevant" when the later visible person/object/region is not in the requested role, target region, support surface, action, object, or result. Do not call an unrelated later person or object an identity switch.

Do not use "uncertain" merely because correctness, exact continuity, exact identity, or exact trajectory is uncertain. Use "uncertain" only when the visible evidence itself is too ambiguous to decide whether there is after-gap judgeable evidence.

The brief_reason must mention the visible after-gap evidence, absence, failure, reset, wrong state, or relevant region. Do not restate only the text request.

The text request itself is not evidence that anything disappeared, returned, changed, or failed. Do not use metadata, filenames, model names, dataset names, or outside knowledge.

Text request:
{world_state_prompt}

Answer true only if all of these are satisfied:

1. Before the interval, the request-relevant subject, object, action, state, target area, support surface, or expected result area is visible enough to establish a visual reference.

2. Then, for a meaningful interval, the request-relevant evidence becomes not visually judgeable from the video pixels. This can happen because it leaves the frame, is hidden, occluded, heavily cropped, too blurred, too small, blocked by camera motion, or the relevant target/result area is no longer visible enough to judge.

3. Later, the video provides clear comparable visual evidence. This can be the same subject/object reappearing, the relevant target/result area becoming visible again, or clear visual evidence of absence, wrong state, reset, failure, replacement, or changed result.

Answer false if any of these apply:

- The request-relevant subject/object/action/state remains continuously visible enough to judge.
- The video only shows ordinary action progress, such as someone walking, sitting, placing an object, carrying an item, or interacting with a target while remaining judgeable.
- Later frames are clearer, closer, or more complete, but there was no meaningful interval where the request-relevant evidence became unjudgeable.
- Camera motion, scene motion, or wording in the text request suggests a gap, but the video pixels do not show a real unjudgeable interval.
- The later visible person/object/region is unrelated to the requested role, target area, action, object, support surface, or result.
- The later evidence is only blurry, ghosted, too small, unstable, or identity-ambiguous, so the requested subject/state/result cannot be identified from pixels.
- There is no clear before reference or no later comparable evidence.

Important:
- Later clear visibility is necessary for a true answer, but it is not sufficient.
- Do not require the exact same physical object to reappear if the relevant target/result area clearly shows absence, change, failure, reset, or a comparable result.
- Do not reject a video merely because some frames are blurry or ghosted; reject only if the later comparable evidence itself is not identifiable from pixels.

- not_visible: the relevant visual thing and the relevant target/result area are not clear enough to judge in this second because they are hidden, outside the frame, too cropped, too small, too blurred, blocked, distorted, or missing without a clear relevant area.
- unrelated: something is visible, but it is not tied to the requested person, object, action, state, target area, support surface, or result.
- unclear: the second is ambiguous.

When more than one status seems possible:
- Use visible when the person/object/action/result itself is clear, or when the target/result area clearly shows absence, failure, reset, replacement, wrong position, wrong state, or wrong final state.
- Use not_visible when neither the relevant visual thing nor a useful target/result area is clear enough to judge.
- Use unrelated only when the visible content is not connected to the request.

Do not mark visible merely because generic background, floor, wall, furniture, or a support surface is visible. A support surface counts only when it helps judge the requested thing in that second.

Judge each second locally. Do not infer visibility from earlier or later seconds.

The per_second list is audit evidence. The final boolean should reflect the whole video. Do not set false only because the exact boundary second of the hidden or unclear interval is hard to locate, as long as the video visibly contains a meaningful request-related interval that is not clear enough to judge, followed by clear judgeable evidence.

Set can_judge_after_gap = true when:
1. before the unclear/hidden interval, there is at least one visible second;
2. then there is a request-related interval with at least one not_visible second. A single unclear second alone is not enough;
3. later, there is a visible second that a human can use to judge the request.

Set can_judge_after_gap = false for ordinary continuous visibility with no request-related not_visible interval, for later visible evidence unrelated to the request, or when the video is too unclear to judge.

Do not set false merely because correctness, exact continuity, exact identity, or exact trajectory is uncertain.
A wrong outcome, failed action, missing object, visible absence, reset, replacement, or wrong final state is still judgeable if it is clearly visible and tied to the request.

For each whole second you can inspect, write one per_second row with exactly one status.

status values:
- visible: the requested person/object/action/result is actually in frame and clear enough to judge in this second. For placement or interaction tasks, a target/result area counts as visible only when the relevant object or final placed/result state is also visible enough to judge.
- not_visible: the requested person/object/action/result is outside the frame, hidden, blocked, cropped out, too small, or absent in this second. A background target area alone, such as an empty pallet, table, brick stack, counter, chair, sofa, bed, bucket, or floor, is not visible evidence.
- collapsed: the video content breaks down in this second: severe ghosting, warped or melted people/objects, duplicated bodies, smeared foreground, unstable generated content, or scene collapse that prevents judging the requested thing.
- unclear: ambiguous, but not severe enough to call collapsed.

Important distinctions:
- If only the background or support surface is visible, use not_visible.
- If only a tiny edge fragment is visible and the requested person/object/action cannot be judged, use not_visible.
- If a relevant object is still visible enough to judge the requested result, use visible even if the actor is partly outside the frame.
- If the scene visibly breaks or turns into a ghosted/warped generated artifact, use collapsed, not not_visible.

OOV_SUBJECT_RESULT_INTEGRITY_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are checking one video.

Use only the video and the text request. Use the text request only to decide what visual subject, result evidence, and scene quality matter. The text request itself is not evidence that anything happened.

Text request:
{world_state_prompt}

Your job is to describe what can actually be judged from the video, one whole second at a time.

Step 1: Choose one main_subject. Prefer the person, animal, or moving object that must remain visually followable to judge the request.
Step 2: Describe result_evidence. This is the target object, final placed object, target area, support surface, or visible result that can help judge the request after the main subject is not visible.
Step 3: For each whole second, fill all three lists.

The video may be shown to you as sampled frames. Do not treat frame count as seconds. Use at most 8 chronological rows in each list. All three lists must use the same sec values, starting at 0 and moving through the visible beginning, middle, and end of the video.

subject_per_second:
- yes: the same main_subject is in frame, identifiable, and clear enough to judge position, action, or state.
- no: the main_subject is outside the frame, hidden, blocked, cropped out, too small, too blurred, or not identifiable.
- unclear: ambiguous.

result_evidence_per_second:
- yes: relevant result evidence is visible and clear enough to judge the request, such as the placed object, target area with the relevant object/result, visible absence/failure/reset, or final state.
- no: the relevant result evidence is not visible or not clear enough. A generic background or empty support surface alone is no.
- unclear: ambiguous.

scene_integrity_per_second:
- coherent: the frame is visually coherent enough to judge the subject or result if they are visible.
- broken: the generated video breaks visually: severe ghosting, melted or duplicated bodies/objects, incompatible scene jump, impossible geometry, or severe smear/noise that prevents judging the request.
- unclear: ambiguous.

Important:
- Judge the same main_subject locally each second. Do not mark the subject yes because only the target area or support surface is visible.
- If the subject is gone but the relevant placed object or final result is clear, subject can be no while result_evidence is yes.
- If the video itself breaks, mark scene_integrity broken even if something resembling the subject remains.
- Do not decide whether the requested outcome is correct. Only report what is judgeable from pixels.

Text request:
{world_state_prompt}

Fill the three evidence fields before deciding final_oov_applicable. Your job is not to score whether the requested event is correct. Your job is only to decide whether there is enough before/gap/later visual evidence for the event to be judged.

Field 1: before_reference
- present = yes when the prompt-critical subject/object/target/result region is visible enough early in the video to establish a visual reference.

Field 2: middle_unjudgeable_gap
- present = yes when, after the before_reference, the prompt-critical evidence becomes not visually judgeable for a meaningful middle interval.
- Count off-screen, hidden, occluded, heavily cropped, tiny edge fragments, too blurred, camera-motion blocked, or otherwise unidentifiable evidence as a gap.
- present = no only when the prompt-critical evidence remains judgeable through the middle portion.

Field 3: later_comparable_evidence
- present = yes when later video pixels provide clear comparable evidence after the gap.
- Do not require the exact same subject or object to reappear.
- Later comparable evidence can be the same subject/object, the target/result/support region, visible absence, change, failure, replacement, reset, wrong state, or wrong result.
- present = no only when there is no later clear comparable visual evidence after the gap.

Important:
- Do not answer false merely because the subject is visible in the first and last parts; the middle gap still matters.
- Do not mark later evidence absent merely because the requested action failed or the original subject is gone. If later pixels clearly show absence, change, failure, replacement, reset, wrong state, or the target/result region, mark later_comparable_evidence present = yes and choose the matching type.

Use the contact sheet as visual evidence. Use the text request only to decide what to look for: the person, animal, object, action, state, target area, support surface, or final result that matters for the request.

The sheet shows sampled frames in chronological order. Each frame has a label such as idx0, idx8, idx16, or similar. Refer to those labels in your notes. Judge only the frames that are shown.

Text request:
{world_state_prompt}

The decision is about whether the sampled frames show a three-part visual pattern, not whether the event is correct.

Answer final_applicable = true only when all three fields below are present = yes:

First scan the sampled frames one by one in chronological order. For every labeled frame you can read, write one frame_visibility entry.
- visible = yes only when the relevant visual evidence is identifiable in that frame.
- visible = no when it is absent, fully hidden, outside the frame, too cropped, too small, too blurred, or too distorted to identify.
- visible = unclear when the frame is ambiguous.
- Do not summarize a range as visible if any frame inside the range is not identifiable.

Field 1: early_reference
- present = yes when an early labeled frame makes the relevant visual evidence clear enough to know what to track.

Field 2: middle_cannot_follow
- present = yes when any non-early frame after early_reference shows that the relevant visual evidence cannot be visually followed. This includes visible = no or visible = unclear in frame_visibility after an early yes.
- present = no only when frame_visibility has no later no/unclear frame for the relevant visual evidence.
- present = no when the relevant person or object naturally leaves after the requested event is already visible and understandable.

Field 3: later_comparison
- present = yes when a later labeled frame gives clear comparable visual evidence after middle_cannot_follow. This may show the same subject/object, the target or result area, a visible absence, a changed state, a failed result, a replacement, or a wrong final state.
- present = no when the later frames are too unclear or unrelated to compare with the early reference.

If the full three-part pattern is uncertain, set final_applicable = false.
